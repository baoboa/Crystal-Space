<h3 class="subsection"> 4.14.2 Physics using Bullet </h3>

<p>The <samp>&lsquo;Bullet&rsquo;</samp> plugin implements physical simulation for Crystal Space using
the <a href="http://www.bulletphysics.com/Bullet/">Bullet library</a>.
</p>
<p>This section will present the main concepts that are used within a physical
simulation. A tutorial with example of codes can be found with the application
<tt>&lsquo;phystut&rsquo;</tt> (see in <tt>&lsquo;CS/apps/tutorial/phystut&rsquo;</tt>).
</p>
<a name="1"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> iDynamics Plugin Interface </h4>

<p>The name of the <samp>&lsquo;Bullet&rsquo;</samp> plugin is <samp>&lsquo;crystalspace.dynamics.bullet&rsquo;</samp>, and
this plugin implements also the iDynamics interface. This interface can be used in
order to create the various dynamic systems that will contain the virtual objects
of the simulation.
</p>
<a name="2"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Dynamic Systems </h4>

<p>Dynamic systems are independent virtual worlds containing physical objects. The
physical objects are active only when they are put inside a dynamic system, and they
will interact only with the objects in the same dynamic system. It is not possible
to put an object in more than one dynamic system.
</p>
<p>At least one dynamic system should therefore be created. Usually, one would need
one dynamic system per Crystal Space sector, the problem being to switch the dynamic
systems when an object crosses a portal. This is not yet made automatically by the
<samp>&lsquo;Bullet&rsquo;</samp> plugin, this is however a feature of the WIP <samp>&lsquo;physics2&rsquo;</samp> plugin.
</p>
<p>Each dynamic system has separate parameters such as the gravity force, the visual
debug mode, the internal scale, and whether or not soft bodies are allowed within the
system.
</p>
<p>Dynamic systems are also used to create the bodies, joints and colliders.
</p>
<p>The common interface for dynamic systems is <code>iDynamicSystem</code>. However, the
<samp>&lsquo;Bullet&rsquo;</samp> plugin also exhibits the interface <code>CS::Physics::Bullet::iDynamicSystem</code>
that extends the system with additional functionalities.
</p>
<a name="3"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Stepping the Physical Simulation </h4>

<p>In order to actually perform the physical simulation, you must specify manually to the
<samp>&lsquo;Bullet&rsquo;</samp> plugin how much time has elapsed since the previous frame. The method
<code>iDynamics::Step()</code> is responsible of that, and takes as a parameter the delta
time value in seconds.
</p>
<p>The <code>iDynamics::Step()</code> method will update all the dynamic systems that have
been created. If you want to control them separately, you can use instead the method
<code>iDynamicSystem::Step()</code>.
</p>
<p>Several other parameters allow to control the stepping and the precision of the
simulation. Those parameters are set using the method
<code>CS::Physics::Bullet::iDynamicSystem::SetStepParameters()</code>.
</p>
<a name="4"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Rigid Bodies and Colliders </h4>

<p>Rigid bodies are bodies whose shape do not vary over the time. They are the physical
objects that are the most used because their motion is the less costly to compute.
</p>
<p>The shape of the rigid bodies are defined by a set of one or more colliders. There
are several types of colliders, varying in computation cost and in stability, and
that can be combined to approximate the shape of the physical object:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sphere</strong>: the sphere is probably the most stable and the less costly collider.
Use it whenever you can.
</li><li>
<strong>Capsule</strong>: a capsule is a cylinder with an half sphere on each side. It is an
excellent collider, either in stability and in computation costs.
</li><li>
<strong>Cylinder</strong>: a cylinder is less stable and more costly than a capsule, this last
collider should be preferred whenever possible.
</li><li>
<strong>Box</strong>: boxes, although simple primitives, are more costly than e.g. a capsule.
</li><li>
<strong>Plane</strong>: planes are infinite in size, and prevent all objects passing to the
other side of the plane. This is perfect e.g. for a floor. Plane colliders can be used
only for static objects.
</li><li>
<strong>Convex mesh</strong>: these are meshes without holes, i.e. these are meshes where every
segment between every vertices of the mesh is still contained within the mesh. Convex
meshes allows a much bigger precision in the approximation of the shape of the object,
but there are however quite costly, and a combination of simpler primitives is generally
more advised.
</li><li>
<strong>Concave mesh</strong>: those are meshes with holes in their shape. Although legal, they
are not advised to be used as non-static objects because they can alter either the
stability or the speed of the simulation. Using them for static objects should however
be fine.
</li></ul>

<p>Once the set of colliders is defined for a given rigid bodies, several other properties
can be set up, such as the mass or the density, the friction and the elasticity of the
body.
</p>
<p>Finally, in order to visualize the rigid body in the rendering engine, a mesh should be
attached to the rigid body, using the method <code>iRigidBody::AttachMesh()</code>. The
position of this mesh will then be updated automatically whenever the physical object
is moved within the simulation. Additional lights and cameras can attached too.
</p>
<p>The common interface for rigid bodies is <code>iRigidBody</code>, but the <samp>&lsquo;Bullet&rsquo;</samp>
plugin also exhibits the interface <code>CS::Physics::Bullet::iRigidBody</code>
</p>
<a name="5"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Static, Dynamic and Kinematic States </h4>

<p>A rigid body can be in one of the states static, dynamic or kinematic, and that state
that will define the behavior of the body in the physical simulation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Static</strong>: a static body is a mesh that never moves, whatever the forces and
collisions that are applied on it. These are used for the parts of the environment where
the objects shouldn't go.
</li><li>
<strong>Dynamic</strong>: a dynamic object is an object that will fall, collider, and react to
the dynamic forces that are applied on it. Most objects will probably need to be put in
this state.
</li><li>
<strong>Kinematic</strong>: a kinematic object is some kind of static object, whose position is
controlled by the user application, and not the simulation. Kinematic objects will
collide with the dynamic objects and push them away. In order to control the motion of
a kinematic body, you can either attach a mesh to it using <code>iRigidBody::AttachMesh()</code>
and simply move that mesh using it's <code>iMovable</code> interface, or alternatively, you can
use the dedicated class <code>CS::Physics::Bullet::iKinematicCallback</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>Changing the state of a rigid body is made through the methods <code>iRigidBody::MakeStatic()</code>,
<code>iRigidBody::MakeDynamic()</code>, <code>CS::Physics::Bullet::iRigidBody::MakeKinematic()</code>
and <code>CS::Physics::Bullet::iRigidBody::SetDynamicState()</code>.
</p>
<a name="6"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Joints and Motors </h4>

<p>Joints (interface <code>iJoint</code>) can be set up between two rigid bodies in order to
constrain their motion together.
</p>
<p>A joint is defined by the degrees of freedom that are allowed, that is whether the
rotations and/or translations are allowed, along what axis, and the minimal and maximal
values that are allowed.
</p>
<p>Additionally, a force can be generated on the joint, and that will act as a motor. This
is made using the method <code>iJoint::SetDesiredVelocity()</code>
</p>
<p>An alternative type of joint is also available with the pivot joint (interface
<code>CS::Physics::Bullet::iPivotJoint</code>), that allows to grab a rigid body at a given
point and move its position in the world. This is useful e.g. for grabbing an object
through a mouse interaction.
</p>
<a name="7"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Soft Bodies </h4>

<p>Soft bodies (interface <code>CS::Physics::Bullet::iSoftBody</code>) are bodies whose shape is
soft and is therefore modified by the physical simulation. Soft bodies are quite costly
to compute and should therefore be used carefully.
</p>
<p>A soft body is basically made of a set of vertices and triangles defining its shape
and the straightness of the forces applied between the vertices. There are several
ways to create a soft body, using the methods <code>CS::Physics::Bullet::iDynamicSystem::CreateRope()</code>,
<code>CreateCloth()</code> and <code>CreateSoftBody()</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Rope</strong>: a rope is a one dimensional line cut in several segments. Unfortunately,
there are no pre-made way to animated a 3D mesh depending on the motion of a rope, so
you would need to display it by your own mean.
</li><li>
<strong>Cloth</strong>: a cloth is a two dimensional array of vertices linked by segments. A
Genmesh can be created automatically for those soft body using the tool class
<code>CS::Physics::Bullet::SoftBodyHelper</code>.
</li><li>
<strong>Genmesh</strong>: the soft body will be created using the vertices and triangles of the
Genmesh.
</li><li>
<strong>Custom</strong>: a custom shape can be defined by providing explicitly the set of
vertices and triangles.
</li></ul>

<p>Displaying a soft body is more complex than a rigid body because its shape should be
updated depending on the physical simulation. In that goal, a soft body animation
controller has been created, allowing to animate automatically the
<a href="MeshObject-Genmesh.html#0">Genmesh</a> associated to a given soft body. See the class
<code>CS::Animation::iSoftBodyAnimationControl</code> and related.
</p>
<p>The parts of a soft body can be attached to a rigid body in order to follow its motion
and act as a joint. This is made using anchors (see <code>CS::Physics::Bullet::iSoftBody::AnchorVertex</code>).
</p>
<p>The <code>CS::Animation::iSoftBodyAnimationControl</code> has also additional functionalities
in order to attach a soft body more precisely to an <a href="MeshObject-Animesh.html#0">Animesh</a>,
and have the position of the anchors updated when the mesh is animated. All of these
functionalities are useful to simulate the clothes of a character. As an example, you
can have a look at the <samp>&lsquo;Krystal&rsquo;</samp> scene in the <tt>&lsquo;avatartest&rsquo;</tt> tutorial
application (in <tt>&lsquo;CS/apps/tutorial/avatartest&rsquo;</tt>).
</p>
<a name="8"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Terrains </h4>

<p>Terrain physical colliders are special objects allowing to create static colliders for
<a href="MeshObject-Terrain2.html#0">terrain2 objects</a>. They are created using the methods
<code>CS::Physics::Bullet::iDynamicSystem::AttachColliderTerrain()</code>.
</p>
<p>If the collider is associated with an object iTerrainSystem, then the
<code>iTerrainCollider</code> will update automatically its collider model whenever a new cell
is added or removed from the terrain.
</p>
<a name="9"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Ragdolls </h4>

<p>For characters and more complex objects made of a set of rigid bodies linked through
joints, then it is advised to use the <a href="MeshObject-Animesh.html#0">Animeshes</a> and the
<a href="Animation-Nodes.html#0">ragdoll animation node</a>. This system allows to manage automatically
the physical simulation and the animation of the whole skeleton of the animesh. This can
be typically be used in order to simulate a character falling on the floor, or to attach
other physical bodies such as clothes to an animesh.
</p>
<a name="10"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Hit Beams </h4>

<p>Collision tests can be performed against a hit beam, e.g. in order to find the objects
that are pointed by a mouse or a weapon. This is similar to the hit beam tests that can be
performed with the Crystal Space engine, although they will act only on the objects that
are present in the dynamic simulation (and not on their visual counterpart in the
rendering engine).
</p>
<p>Hit beams can be done using the method <code>CS::Physics::Bullet::iDynamicSystem::HitBeam</code>.
</p>
<a name="11"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Moving Objects Inside a Dynamic System </h4>

<p>A rigid body cannot be moved freely in a virtual world, and care should be taken
whenever the position of an object has to be changed in order to not alter the
stability of the simulation.
</p>
<p>There are several ways to move a rigid body:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you want to control continually and precisely the motion of an object, then you
should probably use a rigid body in kinematic state. Your body will not react and
be blocked by the other objects, but the objects that are in a dynamic state will
be pushed away by the body that you manipulate.
</li><li>
If you want to push or pull an object, then you should apply virtual forces on it,
and that is the forces that will be the source of the motion of the body.
</li><li>
Alternatively, you can grab a rigid body using a pivot joint, and move the joint
in order to act on the rigid body.
</li><li>
Lastly, if you really want to change the position of the body, you can use the method
<code>iRigidBody::SetTransform()</code> and related, but this should be done as less as
possible. One general problem while doing so, is that dynamic objects that are
already present at the position where you move your object will be violently pulled
away, breaking all realism in the physical simulation. In this case, care should be
taken to test for such cases, and choose an adapated solution to this problem. This
problem is also to be addressed whenever an object is to be spawned.

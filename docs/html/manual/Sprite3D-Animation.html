<h3 class="subsection"> 4.15.2 Sprite3D Animation </h3>

<p><em>Written by Michael Voase,
<a href="mailto:mvoase@midcoast.com.au">mvoase@midcoast.com.au</a>.</em>
</p>
<p>After you have created your sprite you are now probably wondering
what you can do to bring your creation to life? In this section
we explore the two ways in which you can introduce animation
sequences to your sprite.
</p>
<p>For the Crystal Space developer, there are currently two options
for the production and management of sprite animation. The first
option is frame based animation, referred to as an action, and the
second is skeletal animation (which uses the external <small>CAL3D</small>
library).
</p>
<a name="1"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Introduction </h4>

<p>Crystal Space provides two basic mechanisms for animating sprites. The first
is frame based animation in which a mesh is defined in each frame and used
in a loop (see section <a href="MeshObject-Spr3D.html#0">Sprite3D Mesh Object</a>). The second method is skeletal animation
using the <small>CAL3D</small> library (see section <a href="MeshObject-SprCal3D.html#0">SpriteCal3D Mesh Object</a>).
</p>
<p>For the purpose of this document I will describe frame based animation as an
<em>action</em>.  This name is coined from the class the implements frame
animations in the 3D sprite object <samp>&lsquo;iSpriteAction&rsquo;</samp> and has been
traditionally referred to as an <samp>&lsquo;action&rsquo;</samp> in the sprite loader plug in.
</p>
<p>This document presumes that you have an operational copy of Crystal Space.
For details on obtaining and building Crystal Space please refer to the
relevant sections on obtaining (see section <a href="Where-to-Get.html#0">Where to Get Crystal Space</a>) and building
(see section <a href="Building.html#0">Building and Installing</a>) Crystal Space.
</p>
<p>Lastly, actions are specific to sprite 3D. There is no exactly
corresponding interface to genmesh or ball as yet, for example. So I am also
presuming you have read to sections prior to this section about sprites, if
not, then it would be a good idea to do so before delving into this section.
</p>
<a name="2"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Sprite Actions </h4>

<p>A sprite action is a series of frames which contains the position of each
vertex in a sprite for a particular time. This means for each frame, a
complete duplicate of the vertex list must be loaded into the sprite for
each frame. The positions of the vertices of course will vary, however, the
number of vertices in each frame must be equal. We will cover why later.
</p>
<a name="3"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Creating a Sprite in a Map File </h4>

<p>A sprite in a map file consists of two declaration. The first is the
declaration for its <em>factory</em> the second is a declaration of its 
<em>instance</em> in a given sector. The factory declaration is what we are
mostly interested in at the moment.
</p>
<p>Now if you recall from Mesh Object Concepts (see section <a href="MeshObject-Concepts.html#0">MeshObject Concepts</a>), the
factory acts as a database of all the vertices, triangles and texels used
to define a mesh object. The primary purpose of this is to have a single
database for each mesh object. So this is where we will be defining our
sprite with its multiple actions.
</p>
<p>The declaration starts with the <samp>&lsquo;meshfact&rsquo;</samp> token, and looks something
like this:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">&lt;meshfact name=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;
  &lt;plugin&gt;crystalspace.mesh.loader.factory.sprite.3d&lt;/plugin&gt;
  &lt;params&gt;
    &lt;material&gt;white&lt;/material&gt;
    &lt;frame name=&quot;first&quot;&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;0&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;1&quot; z=&quot;0&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;1&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;0&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;1&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/frame&gt;
    &lt;frame name=&quot;second&quot;&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;0&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;1.2&quot; z=&quot;0&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;1.2&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;0&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;1.2&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/frame&gt;
    &lt;frame name=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;0&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;1.4&quot; z=&quot;0&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;1.4&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;0&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;1.4&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/frame&gt;
    &lt;frame name=&quot;fourth&quot;&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;0&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;1.2&quot; z=&quot;0&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;1.2&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;0&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;v x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;1.2&quot; u=&quot;0&quot; v=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/frame&gt;
    
    &lt;t t1=&quot;0&quot; t2=&quot;1&quot; t3=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;t t1=&quot;0&quot; t2=&quot;3&quot; t3=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;t t1=&quot;0&quot; t2=&quot;2&quot; t3=&quot;3&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;t t1=&quot;1&quot; t2=&quot;3&quot; t3=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
    
    &lt;action name=&quot;default&quot;&gt;
      &lt;f name=&quot;first&quot; delay=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;f name=&quot;second&quot; delay=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;f name=&quot;third&quot; delay=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;f name=&quot;fourth&quot; delay=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/action&gt;
  &lt;/params&gt;
&lt;/meshfact&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>This example defines a triangular pyramid which grow larger and smaller.
To put this sprite into action, you also need to declare an instance of
the sprite in a sector. In your map file (somewhere inside a <samp>&lsquo;sector&rsquo;</samp>
declaration), place the following mesh object declaration.
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">&lt;meshobj name=&quot;test1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;plugin&gt;crystalspace.mesh.loader.sprite.3d&lt;/plugin&gt;
  &lt;params&gt;
    &lt;factory&gt;fact&lt;/factory&gt;
    &lt;action&gt;default&lt;/action&gt;
    &lt;tween /&gt;
  &lt;/params&gt;
  &lt;move&gt;
    &lt;v x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; z=&quot;5.0&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/move&gt;
  &lt;priority&gt;object&lt;/priority&gt;
  &lt;zuse /&gt;
&lt;/meshobj&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>After zipping the map file up with your sprite you should see and active
sprite five units in front of you.
</p>
<a name="4"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Meaning of the Sprite </h4>

<p>Okay, we have an example of an animation. As you can see from the example,
the sprite <em>factory</em> declaration, the sprite consists of four frames
each enclosed in the <samp>&lsquo;frame&rsquo;</samp> keyword. Each frame defines the vertices
of the pyramid in each frame. The <samp>&lsquo;v&rsquo;</samp> token stands for <em>vertex</em>.
You will also note that each frame contains a name. This is important as the
name is used to reference the frame. This applies to both map files and
the sprite 3D interface.
</p>
<p>After the frames have been defined, a list of triangles is then declared.
Note that the <samp>&lsquo;t&rsquo;</samp> tokens are declared after the frames. Trying
to define the triangles before the frames will result in an error and will
be flagged as such. Each <samp>&lsquo;t&rsquo;</samp> declaration contains three indices
to the defined frame vertices. The index starts at zero and has a maximum
value equal the number of vertices minus one. During the course of animation
the triangle lists are applied to the corresponding frame and are then
sent to the graphics renderer. This is one reason why each frame must
contain the same number of vertices. Lastly, at the end of the mesh factory
declaration, there is an <samp>&lsquo;action&rsquo;</samp> declared. 
</p>
<a name="5"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Action Declaration </h4>

<p>The declaration starts with the <samp>&lsquo;action&rsquo;</samp> token and is then followed by
the name of the action. Setting the name is important as this is how you
will reference the action both in the map file and in the sprite interface.
Its also a good idea <em>not</em> to use the same name twice, as you will prevent
the second action from being accessed. You can use the same name for an action
and a frame, as they are stored in different places. In general though,
never use the same name for two items of the same type, whether it be a mesh
object, a frame, or whatever.
</p>
<p>After the name of the action, we enter into the body of the action where the
frame <em>sequences</em> are defined. Each frame of the sequence starts with
the <samp>&lsquo;F&rsquo;</samp> token (standing for frame) and contains the name of the frame
and the duration that it is valid for. The frame name must be one from the 
previous list of frames and the duration is in milliseconds. The duration 
represents how long the frame will be shown for. This sprite contains only
one action. It can contain many actions. However, in all cases there must be
at least one action (usually called <em>default</em>) defined for the sprite.
</p>
<p>Lastly to implement this action, the <samp>&lsquo;action&rsquo;</samp> keyword is used in the
mesh object declaration to tell the engine which action to use on this sprite
instance. If no action is defined in the mesh object then the engine will
use the first action defined in the factory regardless of its name.
</p>
<a name="6"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Tweening and Actions. </h4>

<p>You may have noticed that the animation looks somewhat jumpy when viewed.
This is due to the tweening flag on the sprite <em>instance</em> being set
to false. To enable tweening, set the tweening flag to true (it is normally
enabled). Tweening is a method of producing a smoother animation by
interpolating the position of the vertices between frame based on a ratio
of the time into the frame and the duration of the frame. Enabling
tweening in an animation involves an additional overhead in calculating
the interpolated vertices, however, produces a more satisfactory result.
This is also the second reason why each frame must have the same number
of vertices.
</p>
<a name="7"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Interfacing with the Sprite </h4>

<p>To begin this section, I am assuming here that you are aware of how to obtain
the various interfaces from the engine.  If not, read the documentation for
<small>SCF</small>, the Shared Class Facility.  See section <a href="SCF.html#0">Shared Class Facility (<small>SCF</small>)</a>.  I will be using terminology
and concepts which are explained in that section.  If you are only interested
in writing map files for the engine then you can skip ahead to the next
section.
</p>
<p>Secondly, I am also presuming that you have loaded your sprite into the engine,
and have access to that sprite via the <samp>&lsquo;iEngine&rsquo;</samp> interface.  That implies
that you have written a basic Crystal Space application (or are hacking up an
existing application), and can access your sprite mesh factory using calls
similar to the following:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">iMeshFactoryWrapper *fwrap = Engine-&gt;FindMeshFactory(&quot;name&quot;);
iMeshObjectFactory *fact = fwrap-&gt;GetMeshObjectFactory();

iMeshWrapper *mwrap = Engine-&gt;FindMeshObject(&quot;name&quot;);
iMeshObject *mesh = mwrap-&gt;GetMeshObject();
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>With the name being the name of your mesh factory or object, respectively.
There are four main interfaces that we will be dealing with in this section,
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>iSpriteFrame</code> 
</li><li>
<code>iSpriteAction</code> 
</li><li>
<code>iSprite3DFactoryState</code> 
</li><li>
<code>iSprite3DState</code>. 
</li></ul>

<p>The declarations for these interfaces can be found in 
<tt>&lsquo;CS/include/imesh/sprite3d.h&rsquo;</tt>. The first two interfaces can be obtained
by using the <code>FindFrame()</code> and <code>FindAction()</code> methods  in the 
<samp>&lsquo;iSprite3dFactoryState&rsquo;</samp> interface (described later).
The third interface can be obtained by querying the <samp>&lsquo;iMeshObjectFactory&rsquo;</samp>
interface. The <samp>&lsquo;iSprite3DState&rsquo;</samp> interface can be obtained from the
<samp>&lsquo;iMeshObject&rsquo;</samp> interface. The following is a summary of the methods in
each interface and what they do. An example of obtaining the state interfaces
is described below:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">csRef&lt;iSprite3dFactoryState&gt; fstat =
  scfQueryInterface&lt;iSprite3dFactoryState&gt; (fact);
csRef&lt;iSprite3DState&gt; stat =
  scfQueryInterface&lt;iSprite3DState&gt; (mesh);
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The <samp>&lsquo;mesh&rsquo;</samp> and <samp>&lsquo;fact&rsquo;</samp> variables are the ones mentioned earlier in
this chapter.  The following is summary of the methods and interface that are
useful to the sprite animator during production.  This summary does not fully
document the <samp>&lsquo;iSprite3DState&rsquo;</samp> or <samp>&lsquo;iSprite3DFactoryState&rsquo;</samp> interfaces
since they are adequately documented elsewhere.  Only methods which are
relevant to frame animation are treated here.

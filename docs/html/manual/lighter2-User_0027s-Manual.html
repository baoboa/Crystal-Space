<h3 class="subsection"> 5.6.1 <code>lighter2</code> User's Manual </h3>

<a name="1"></a>
<h2 class="heading"> Introduction </h2>

<p><code>lighter2</code> is a tool to compute <em>static lighting</em> for a CrystalSpace
world. 
</p>
<p><em>Static</em> means that the lighting effects on objects in the world
are precomputed in a preprocessing step during and after modelling of the 
world. The benefit is that it is very cheap to render; it makes no difference
if a world uses one or one thousand lights, the runtime performance is the
same. Shadows are supported as well. However, as the name &ldquo;static&rdquo; implies,
the lighting can't be changed at runtime - that is, moving a light source
won't have an effect on statically lit geometry.
</p>

<p>The opposite is <em>dynamic lighting</em> which is computed entirely at runtime.
This means that light sources can be moved as desired, with changes immediately
being reflected; however, shadows and multiple light sources all increase the
runtime cost of lighting.
</p>
<p>In practice, static and dynamic light can be mixed: lights sources that don't
change their position (e.g. a streetlight) can be computed statically, while
moving light sources (e.g. a flashlight held by the player) are computed
dynamically.
</p>
<a name="2"></a>
<h2 class="heading"> Basic Usage </h2>

<p><code>lighter2</code> is usually invoked from the command line:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">lighter2 [options] &lt;map file&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p><code>options</code> optionally specify one or more command-line options (which are
described in the course of this section). <code>map file</code> specifies the path to
a directory or <small>ZIP</small> file containing an <small>XML</small> map file named <tt>&lsquo;world&rsquo;</tt>
or the direct file name of an <small>XML</small> map file. <em>Note:</em> it is recommended
to extract worlds in <small>ZIP</small> files before lighting as this will result in
noticeably faster disk input/output, especially when the results are saved.
</p>
<p>Once started, lighting will be computed for the world without further user
intervention being necessary.
</p>
<a name="3"></a>
<h2 class="heading"> Light computation </h2>

<p>Lighting for objects is either computed as a <em>lightmap</em> or
<em>per-vertex</em>.
</p>
<p><em>Lightmap lighting</em> can be thought of as a grid being laid over surfaces
in the world and the lighting for a surface being computed at the grid points.
</p>
<p>The distribution of lighting grid points for a surface is controlled by the
<em>lightmap density</em>. This density specifies the amount of sample points 
in u- respectively v-direction of the surface, measured in points per world 
unit. E.g. a density of 2 means 2 by 2 sample points for a square of 
1 by 1 world units of a surface. If a world unit equals one meter, this would 
mean a lighting value is computed every 0.5m.
</p>
<p>Increasing the lightmap density means shadows get more detailed, but lightmaps
also get bigger (and more lightmaps may be produced).  Decreasing the lightmap
density reduces lightmap sizes and amounts, but also means less detailed and
blurrier shadows. However, it may make sense for cases where shadows are not
very detailed anyway (such as large outdoor surfaces).
</p>
<p>The default lightmap density is 2x2, which can usually be considered &ldquo;low&rdquo; 
quality. A density of 8x8 can be considered &ldquo;medium&rdquo; quality and 16x16 as
&ldquo;high&rdquo; quality and sufficient in most cases.
</p>
<p><em>Per-Vertex lighting</em> means that lighting for surfaces is computed at
its vertices.
</p>
<a name="4"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> When to Use Per-vertex Lighting </h3>

<p>For objects that consist of relatively large and few surfaces lightmap lighting
is great: light is sampled at a lot of points distributed over the surfaces,
giving good light and shadow details. Using per-vertex lighting for such kind
of objects would mean that lighting is only sampled at the surface corner
and interpolated over the surface, meaning much detail is lost.
</p>
<p>However, on highly tesselated objects (ie lots of small surfaces) lightmap 
lighting usually produces sub-par results. Due to the way the lightmapper 
works it can happen that a lot of seams are visible (especially when surfaces 
are smaller than the spacing of the lightmap grid). But if an object is
highly tesselated it usually means that there are so many vertices so close
together that sampling lighting at these can already give sufficient light
and shadow detail, giving results as good as lightmaps, even though lighting
for individual surfaces is only interpolated over them.
</p>
<p>Below is a comparison between different lightmap densities and per-vertex
lighting on a relatively highly tesselated, round object:
</p>
<p><img src="content/lighter2/pvlcompare.jpg" alt="content/lighter2/pvlcompare">
</p>
<p>At the lowest used density (4x4), the object appears rather un-smooth with a
number of visible edges and shadow issues. At the next density &ndash; 16x16,
a 16-fold increase from the lowest lightmap resolution &ndash; the appearance is
smoother, but still some visible artifacts remain.  With the highest density
&ndash; 64x64 &ndash; the object looks acceptable, but the price being a ridiculously
high lightmap density which is directly reflected in a hight number of lightmaps
needed, high runtime memory usage and, ultimatively, lower runtime performance. 
In comparison, the vertex-lit variant has a bit less detailed shadows, but
looks more smooth overall with zero visible edges. Per-vertex lighting also has
only low memory requirements.
</p>
<p>Per-vertex lighting can also be beneficial on objects quite the opposite: when
surfaces are extremely large, lightmaps will also be. If a large object is
lit in such a way that very few shadows are cast on it, meaning that the
lighting is very smooth on the surfaces and varies only little, there is
no benefit from using lightmaps, as the shadowing detail they can possible 
provide is not present. Using per-vertex lighting on such an object can save
resources by omitting the lightmaps with little visual difference.

<h2 class="heading"> Setting Global Options </h2>

<p>Some options are &ldquo;global&rdquo; and affect all meshes or factories or the execution
of <code>lighter2</code> itself. These options can be set in two ways: the command
line and a configuration file.
</p>
<p>For example, the global option <samp>&lsquo;foo&rsquo;</samp> can be set to the value <samp>&lsquo;bar&rsquo;</samp> 
in any of the following ways:
</p><ul>
<li> On the command line by specifying <code>-foo=bar</code>.
</li><li> In a configuration file by setting the key <samp>&lsquo;Lighter2.foo=bar&rsquo;</samp>.
The configuration file can be utilized via CrystalSpace's <code>-cfgfile</code>
command line option.
</li><li> In <tt>&lsquo;lighter2.cfg&rsquo;</tt> by setting the key <samp>&lsquo;Lighter2.foo=bar&rsquo;</samp>.
</li></ul>

<p>Note that this is list is ordered by precedence &ndash; e.g. a command line option
will always override an option set in a configuration file, and a
user-specified configuration file will always override options from
<tt>&lsquo;lighter2.cfg&rsquo;</tt>.
</p>
<a name="6"></a>
<h2 class="heading"> List of Options </h2>

<a name="7"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> Lightmap Density </h3>

<p>Please see the &ldquo;Light computation&rdquo; section above for an explanation of
lightmap density.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Can be set on mesh factories.
</li><li> Can be set globally: <code>lmdensity</code>
</li></ul>

<a name="8"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> Per-Vertex Lighting </h3>

<p>Per-vertex lighting means that lighting is not computed on a grid laid over the
surfaces but at the vertices of a mesh.
</p>
<p>For a discussion of cases where using per-vertex lighting can be beneficial
read the paragraph &ldquo;When to Use Per-vertex Lighting&rdquo;.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Can be set on mesh factories.
</li><li> Can be set on mesh objects. Note that if per-vertex lighting has been
  enabled for a factory it can't be disabled for objects of that factory.
</li></ul>

<a name="9"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> Disable self shadows </h3>

<p>Disables casting of shadows from an object onto itself.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Can be set on mesh factories.
</li><li> Can be set on mesh objects.
</li></ul>

<a name="10"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> Advanced Options </h3>

<a name="11"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Black Threshold </h4>

<p>This controls the threshold of a lightmap pixel below which it is considered
black. Can be used to &quot;cull&quot; away lightmaps that have only very, very low
lighting values. However, while setting this value high may cause less 
lightmaps to be produced, it may also cause visible lighting artifacts
(as low lightmap values are actually amplified at runtime).
</p>
<ul>
<li> Can be set globally: <code>blackthreshold</code>.
</li></ul>

<a name="12"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Normals Tolerance </h4>

<p>When computing the lightmap layout (that is, determining the area of the
lightmap onto which a surface is mapped), coplanar surfaces are layouted
adjacent to each other.  However, in practice, due to inaccuracies etc.
some surfaces may not be exactly coplanar, but close enough to be
practically considered as such.  The normals tolerance specifies the
maximum angle between two surface normals (in degrees) at which the
surfaces are still considered coplanar. 
</p>
<ul>
<li> Can be set globally: <code>normalstolerance</code>.
</li></ul>

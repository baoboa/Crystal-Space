<h4 class="subsubsection"> 4.12.1.1 Shader System Overview </h4>

<a name="1"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> Terminology </h3>

<p>The term &ldquo;shader&rdquo; is used for a number of different things in computer
graphics.  In DirectX, and recently OpenGL, &ldquo;shader&rdquo; is used to name
the programs running on the <small>GPU</small> to process vertex and fragment data.
Offline rendering packages use the term to describe the complete appearance 
of a surface.
</p> 
<p>Shaders in Crystal Space are closer to the second meaning, as they are a
generic surface description.  (&ldquo;Shaders&rdquo; in the DirectX/OpenGL sense are
appropriately called &ldquo;programs&rdquo; in Crystal Space.)  They are generic as 
a single shader describes a class of a surface, or even classes of surfaces,
and specific aspects can be controlled via parameters.  The benefit is that
shaders are reusable, and actual values for such parameters can be provided 
by a material and other instances, defining the actual look of a surface.  As
an example, you may create a shader &ldquo;cloth&rdquo; emulating a cloth-like look.
The shader would provide a generic description of the surface, with specific
parameters (e.g. the actual color or pattern, whether it appears shiny or
dull) being set as material properties. Hence you can have a lot of &ldquo;cloth&rdquo;
materials by just changing these properties. (The mechanism for this are the 
&ldquo;shader variables&rdquo;, described further below.)
</p>
<a name="2"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> Components of a Shader </h3>

<p>A shader itself consists of a number of components:
</p><ul>
<li> Metadata
</li><li> Shader variables
</li><li> One or more techniques
</li><li> One or more passes per technique
</li><li> Mappings for each pass
</li><li> An optional vertex processor for each pass
</li><li> A vertex program for each pass
</li><li> A fragment program for each pass 
</li></ul>

<a name="3"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Metadata </h4>

<p>This contains information about the shader as a whole which are relevant for
the engine or the external tools. Currently, this only consists of the number
of lights a shader can handle at most; in the future, the metadata may be
expanded with e.g. descriptions of the parameters that can be controlled.
</p>
<a name="4"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Shader Variables </h4>

<p>Shader variables are &ldquo;parameters&rdquo; for shaders and are commonly used for
things that should be customizeable, e.g. the diffuse texture of a surface
or its shininess. A shader variable defined in the shader itself acts like a 
default value which can be overridden by other shader variable sources like
materials. Shader variables are more described in a more detailed fashion
further down. A number of commonly used shader variables are listed in
<a href="Shader-Variables.html#0">Shader Variables</a>.
</p>
<a name="5"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Techniques </h4>

<p>A shader consists of multiple techniques.  The idea is that each technique
realizes the same basic effect, but in a different fashion.  At runtime, a
technique is selected which is supported by the current hardware and renderer.
This allows to support of hardware with different capabilities by the same
shader.  Each technique is assigned a priority, and all technique are tried
in the order of their priority, highest first.  Usually, the highest priority
technique is geared towards more advanced hardware, while lower priorities
gradually accomodate less advanced hardware (commonly also degrading the
quality since not all effects can be achieved on all hardware).
</p>
<p>Another mechanism to control the shader selection are the so-called &ldquo;shader
tags&rdquo;.  Currently, a tag can be set to be required by a technique to have
the latter selected, or set to prevent a technique that has this tag to be
selected.  Tags can be controlled from the configuration system, hence this
mechanism offers a simple way to disable a number of techniques from a
configuration utility, e.g. to allow the user to disable certain effects to
gain higher performance. 
</p>
<a name="6"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Passes </h4>

<p>Shader programs as well as buffer and texture bindings are associated with
passes.  During rendering, a mesh is drawn once for each pass in the used
shader: essentially, the same geometry is drawn multiple times with different
shader programs (and hence different processing).  Multiple passes can be
used to overcome hardware limitations: for example, a lightmapped surface
that should &ldquo;glow&rdquo; needs three textures (lightmap, diffuse texture, glow
mask), however, implementing it as a single-pass technique is impossible on
hardware that features only two texture units.  Using multiple passes can
be used here to get around the limitation: the first pass combines normal
lighting and glow, while the second pass applies the diffuse texture.
</p>
<p>Also made possible are special effects: for example a fur shader using fur
shells; each fur shell can be a separate pass.
</p>
<p>Using multiple passes has its backdraws, though: obviously, drawing geometry
multiple times is potentially more expensive than drawing it once. Also, the
only way to propagate data between multiple passes is the framebuffer: you can
only &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; data to the immediately following pass, and it can only be
combined with the this passes output via the fragment blending.  (Also, in very
dire circumstances the alpha channel may not be available for propagation.)
</p>
<a name="7"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Shader Programs </h4>

<p>Shader programs is where it is defined how a vertex of a mesh or a fragment 
of a triangle are processed.  Consequently, the two types of programs needed
are vertex and fragment programs.  Both programs are usually tuned to work
together to produce a certain effect or appearance.
</p>
<p>Shader programs in Crystal Space are abstracted into plugins.  Plugins exist
for e.g. <small>ARB</small> vertex or fragment programs, Cg vertex or fragment programs
or fixed function pipeline setup (not actually &ldquo;true&rdquo; programs, but by
Crystal Space provided by shader program plugins as well).
</p>
<p>A Crystal Space-specific feature grouped into shader programs is the support
for &ldquo;vertex processors&rdquo;.  These are not shader programs in the sense of being
executed on the GPU, rather they're plugins that manipulate vertex data in
software.  The motivation for this feature was to allow vertex manipulation
that might be too complicated, or simply impossible due hardware limitations,
to realize with GPU vertex programs (the specific motivation was software
lighting: some aspects of CS' light support don't map well to older hardware).
</p>
<a name="8"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Mappings </h4>

<p>Shader programs, as all programs, need some kind of input.  For vertex
programs, it's data varying per-vertex, provided by vertex buffers.  For
fragment programs, it's textures as well as per-vertex data (output by the
vertex program - sometimes, computed in the vertex program, sometimes just
data specified by the user passed through). Both also take uniform 
parameters - that is, data that does not change over the geometry drawn.
</p>
<p>Vertex buffers, textures and uniform parameters are mapped to program inputs
via <small>XML</small> statements.  The actual format of the mapping destinations
depends on the shader programs used - e.g. for Cg programs, variable names
used in the actual programs can be utilized as targets.  Other program types
may have more abstract mappings (e.g. registers for <small>ARB</small> programs).
</p>

<a name="9"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> Shader Variables </h3>

<p>Shader variables serve as an important carrier for data related to rendering
in Crystal Space.  The function &ldquo;customize shaders&rdquo; is actually just a
subset of what shader variables are used for; other uses include passing
around data inside the engine itself.
</p>
<p>Shader variables are identified by a name which is a string ID obtained
from the global <code>iShaderVarStringSet</code>.  Note that a name is not unique
to an instance of a variable.  Indeed, commonly multiple variables will have
the same name; there is no global single namespace of variables, which one is
chosen depends on what variables are attached to the different contexts -
see below.
</p>
<p>Shader variables can contain vectors, transforms, but also textures, vertex 
buffers and even arrays of other shader variables.
</p>
<p>Shader variables are provided by so-called &ldquo;shader variable contexts&rdquo;.  
Before rendering a mesh, the render loop collects shader variables from the 
contexts.  There is a hardcoded order of preference: some contexts override 
variables from other contexts, if variables of the same name exist.
</p>
<p>Contexts are provided by (in order of increasing preference):
</p><ul>
<li> Shader manager - The shader manager provides &ldquo;global&rdquo; shader 
variables.  Currently, only a variable <samp>&lsquo;standard time&rsquo;</samp> is provided, 
which contains the time from the virtual clock, useful for animations in 
shaders.
</li><li> Current Light - This context contain shader variables attached to 
the current light being used for rendering.  The idea is to potentially allow 
light-specific effects, e.g. the ability to support &ldquo;projectors&rdquo; by having 
a texture attached to a light.
</li><li> Renderstep - This context is not accessible by the user.  It provides 
shader variables that are filled from &ldquo;special&rdquo; sources as a convenience for 
shaders, like <samp>&lsquo;object2 world transform&rsquo;</samp>.
</li><li> Rendermesh - This context is also not accessible by the user.  It 
contains shader variables provided by mesh objects.  Usually these are 
buffers with geometry, but in some special cases also textures (e.g. the 
GenMesh mesh provides lightmaps, the terrain mesh splatting masks).
</li><li> Mesh object wrapper - Shader variables can be attached to mesh objects 
in order to realize per-mesh effects.  E.g. you can write a &ldquo;colorize&rdquo; 
shader that renders a surface with a given tint and then attach shader 
variables with the tint color to mesh wrappers: this will have the result 
that different meshes are tinted differently.  Another application for this 
mechanism is lightmaps, which are attached to a mesh object via shader 
variables.
</li><li> Shader - Shader variables can be defined by shaders itself.  The idea 
behind this is to allow providing &ldquo;default&rdquo; values for shader parameters: 
if a shader variable isn't overridden by any context with higher precedence, 
it still has some sensible default value.
</li><li> Material - This is probably the context that is most used.  Shader 
specific parameters can be set on a per-material basis.  This includes 
textures (e.g. normal maps, but also the diffuse texture is internally 
backed by a shader variable) but also all other kinds of parameters.
</li></ul>

<a name="10"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> Shader expressions </h3>

<p>Crystal Space does not just support fixed values for shader variables, but also 
allows to specify simple formulas to dynamically compute values as well.
Applications include transformation of values provided by the user or simple
animations (e.g. a pulsating glow).
</p>
<a name="11"></a>
<h3 class="subheading"> Shader conditions and processing instructions </h3>

<a name="12"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Basic conditions </h4>

<p>Shader conditionals allow a single shader to support an array of different
features.  For example, a shader might have to support both per-vertex and
lightmap lighting, and optionally support a normal map and/or a glow map.
</p> 
<p>Without conditionals, basically all combinations of these features would
require a separate shader: obviously a rather large amount of work to
begin with and a continued maintenance headache, since a single change must
be propagated to a number of shaders.
</p>
<p>Shader conditionals allow to litter &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; throughout a shader.  The
possible conditions include tests for the existance of shader variables and
comparisons between variables or immediate values.
</p>
<p>This allows to only let the code that supports different features differ: e.g.
in the case above, around the lighting code could be a condition that tests
for the existance of a lightmap; is one present, lightmap lighting is utilized,
otherwise per-vertex lighting.
</p>
<a name="13"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Processing instruction </h4>

<p>A feature useful for code reduction are templates.  These are blocks of XML
that can be inserted in a place via a processing instruction.  Also supported
are parameters, so special placeholders in the XML will be replaced by the
value given as a parameter.
</p>
<p>Related to this is <small>XML</small> generation in a fashion akin to <code>for</code>-loops.
A block of <small>XML</small> is repeated a number of times, with a counting variable 
that can be inserted into <small>XML</small> via placeholders the same way template 
parameters can be inserted.
</p>
<p>Last but not least other files can be included.  This can be used to move
recurring blocks of XML into separate file, or have the included file
generate a number of utility templates.
</p>
<p>For a detailed reference of both shader conditions and processing instructions
see section <a href="Shader-Conditions-and-Processing-Instructions-Reference.html#0">Shader Conditions and Processing Instructions Reference</a>. 
</p>
<a name="14"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Caveats </h4>

<p>There are some pitfalls in shader conditions and processing instructions that 
one needs to be aware of:
</p><ul>
<li> Processing - There is a difference between shader conditions and 
processing instructions that is not obvious.  Shader conditions are 
processed dynamically - in principle, at runtime, each condition is evaluated
and a new shader document created, based on the evaluation results.
Processing instructions (i.e. templates and inclusions) are processed at 
parse time - the effects of these instructions are applied immediately.  

<p>This has e.g. the practical consequence that template definitions inside 
conditions will not work as probably expected - that is, instead of a 
template only being defined when the enclosing condition is true, it's 
always defined, no matter the condition. (The workaround for this
particular issue is to move the condition into the template.)
</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the recognition whether a conditional instruction is
statically or dynamically processed, static processing instructions start by
convention with an uppercase letter, while dynamic conditions start with a
lowercase letter.
</p></li><li> Based on <small>XML</small> - The shader conditionals and processing instructions 
work on top of <small>XML</small>. This means that a condition branch or templated 
block must be a properly closed block of <small>XML</small>; likewise, conditionals and 
instructions must be completely contained in a block of <small>XML</small>.
</li></ul>
